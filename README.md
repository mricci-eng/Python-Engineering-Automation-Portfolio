# Python for Engineering Automation - Portfolio
# Mattia Ricci | Professional Engineer (Mechanical & IXL Signalling)
Welcome to my portfolio. I am a Mechanical and Industrial Engineer specializing in safety-critical railway signalling systems (SIL-4 IXL).

Beyond my core engineering duties, I have a proven track record of independently identifying critical process bottlenecks and developing robust Python automation tools to solve them. These tools have saved hundreds of engineering hours, reduced project risk, and improved data quality and consistency. This portfolio provides a high-level showcase of these initiatives.

Tool Showcase
1. HMI/Alarm Multilingual Translation System
A robust desktop application developed to support the complex multilingual data requirements of the Brussels Metro Modernisation project.

The Challenge: The project required the translation of over 30,000 unique, deeply nested JSON strings for the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). A manual approach presented significant risks to the project schedule and data integrity.
My Initiative: To enhance the workflow, I independently engineered a standalone Python application to automate the entire process. The system intelligently parses source data, cross-references it with a master translation file, and rebuilds the target language files, guaranteeing structural preservation and data integrity.
Key Features & Impact:
Engineering Time Obliterated: Reduced the hands-on engineering effort for data extraction and integration from over a month of high-risk manual work to under 5 minutes of automated processing.
Workflow Revolutionized: This automation was the key enabler that compressed the entire end-to-end translation workflow, including the external translation team's turnaround, into a predictable 3-day cycle, a timeline that was previously impossible.
Engineered for Usability: Features a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with ttkbootstrap, enabling non-developer team members to execute the translation workflow safely and efficiently.
Robust & Scalable: Architected using Object-Oriented principles and a multi-threaded design to handle long-running operations without compromising user experience, making the tool adaptable for future projects.
